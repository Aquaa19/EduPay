            // the "colors" for that year will naturally disappear from the display.
            // The promotion history itself should remain intact as it's a factual record.

            // So, no explicit removal from promotion_history is needed here, as it's a historical record.
            // The example "Jun 2026: Year update â†’ Sem 1 colors erased" means that for the *display*
            // of 2026, Sem 1 payments from 2025 (if any were displayed) are no longer relevant,
            // and the student will be in Sem 3 (Coral) for June 2026.

            // 3. Update current semester if maximum not reached (this is handled by PromotionManager
            //    which is triggered by specific months, not annually. However, if a student
            //    has completed Sem 6, they might be considered "graduated" and not tracked further.
            //    For this app, students continue in their current semester until promoted.)
            //    The prompt says "Update current semester if maximum not reached".
            //    This implies a student might automatically advance if they were, say, in Sem 6
            //    and completed it, but the promotion rules are specific (March/September).
            //    So, this part is implicitly handled by the promotion logic.
            //    If a student reaches Sem 6, they stay in Sem 6 unless explicitly handled as "graduated".
